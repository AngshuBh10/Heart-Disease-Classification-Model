 This is a classification model which classifies whether a person dies or not due to heart fail .
 This model is based on a dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data?select=heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv .
 Data set is splitted into training data (80% data of the original dataset) and test data (20% data of the original dataset)
 Three classification algorithms ( Logistic Regression , Decision Tree and Naive Bayes ) are used.
 Out of these three, Decision Tree Classifier works better with 85% accuracy .
 We can also get various insights from the dataset.
 We can see death rate is  higher among patients who have a high blood pressure (37.14%) than who don't have a high blood pressure(29.38%)
 Also death rate among female patients (32.38%) is slightly higher than male patients (31.95%).
 Other factors (like whether they patient has diabetes or whether they smoke or not) has a very little contribution on the classification.
